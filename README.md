Blender is an open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entire 3D pipeline, including modeling, sculpting, animation, rigging, rendering, and more. It is widely used for creating animations, visual effects, art, and interactive applications. Blender is highly customizable and supported by a large and active community. Below, you can find a few examples of my work created with Blender.
